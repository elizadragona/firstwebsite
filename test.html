    <h2>Streetstyle Fashion</h2>
    <p>Fashion is ever-changing and develops through time. Fashion trends influence people's style and personal interests in various ways. Dressing styles vary not only over time but also from one place to another. For example, people in London may not have the same style as people in Athens.</p>

    <p>A city's influence on fashion can be based on factors such as weather, globalization, economy, and more.</p>

    <h2>Streetwear Style</h2>

Streetwear is associated with mixing high and low fashion, using bold accessories and statement pieces, and incorporating vintage and thrifted finds.</p>
